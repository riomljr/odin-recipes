    <h2>How to cook the perfect half scrambled eggs everytime</h2>
        <p>
        Unlike traditional fully scrambled, half scrambled eggs taste great.
         And you can tell them apart from powdered eggs.
        </p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>    
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs (pasture raised preferrably)</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
            <li>Coarse sea salt</li>
            <li>cheese(optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>heat pan to medium/high (more towards medium)</li>
            <li>Place butter on pan and spread it around evenly</li>
            <li>Once butter is fully melted, crack eggs one at a time on pan</li>
            <li>let the eggs sit for about a minute, let them cook</li>
            <li>sprinkle some black pepper (as much as you want)</li>
            <li>sprink a generous "pinch" of coarse salt</li> 
            <li>once the egg whites seems to have cooked, scramble the eggs</li>
            <li>as as soon as you scramble the eggs turn off the heat</li>
            <li>let them finish cooking with the residual heat for about 30 seconds </li>
            <li>serve and add cheese (optional)</li>


        </ol>
